Thrift VBA
==========

I never stopped to wonder whether I should.

A great addition to [Webxcel](https://github.com/michaelneu/webxcel).

Supports the following transport(s):

 * THttpClient

Supports the following protocol(s):

 * TBinaryProtocol

No servers are implemented (this is a good thing, it should stay like that).
